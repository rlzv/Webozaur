This is a replica for a TinderDog website. It doesn't have functionalities(e.g. JS), it is made up for an exercise.
 I made this project for getting more used to the CSS framework, Bootstrap, where I styled some predefined Bootstrap components for my needs. Here, I have understended more exactly how I should arrange my page to look more user-friendly and to make it responsive for all categories of devices.

 Pictures from Font Awesome are styled for my prefferencies too, because, when you import them, they are quite small, usually good as default for the footer or a logo. This projects covers a lot of concepts like z-index with the iphone photo,css grid system, carousel slides, media querrys, division by colums and rows for the pricing plans where it get's smaller for the tablet size, responsive for the phone too.
